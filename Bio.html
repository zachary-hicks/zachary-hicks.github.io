		<div> I am Sir Theodore I. Mattik, Esq. Heir to the Smuckers fortune. Here's a little bit more to get to know about me</div>
		<div> I am 38 years old and I live in my parents house. I know that sounds bad, but they're loaded and it's a 30 room mansion.</div>
		<div> Some of my favorite things to do are to just hangout with the boys. I'm a people person.</div>
		
		</p> 
		
		
	<p>
		<div> I was born April 27th 1979, that makes me a Taurus ladies.</div>
		<div> Being super rich I had everything I could want, and it was great. I love having stuff.</div>
		<div> By the time I was 8 I had over 50 awards for various activities, mostly for being a cool dude.</div>
		<div> At the age of 12 I owned 5 Lambos and a boat. A boat! Boats are awesome. You own a boat? I did. I was 12.</div>
		<div> School was never an issue for me. If my grades started to get too low I would just pay off the teachers. I graduated with a 4.0.</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		
		<div> Twenty five years had gone by and I had money, things, and an awesome posse, but I still felt like something was missing.</div>
		<div> It was more money and things. But what's the best way to get that? Treasure hunting of course!</div>
		<div> I did my research on several pirates in order to locate burried treaure. That booty would be mine!</div>
		<div> Step one, buy another boat. Yes, I already had a boat, but everyone knows you have to retire your first boat after 5 years. That's rule 19 of boats.</div>
		<div> The next thing I had to do was hire a pirate crew, because who else knows burried treasure than a pirate?</div>
		<div> It turns out that that's not a thing anymore so I just bought costumes for my posse. Good enough.</div>
		<div> We set sail on the open sea to a little known place, Taiwan!</div>
		</p>
		<p>
		
		<div> For being a place that no one knows about, there are a lot of people in Taiwan. Mostly just hustling Children.</div>
		<div> The kids there were actually very mean. I kept getting my wallet stolen. In hindsight after the first few times I probably shouldn't have bought more.</div>
		<div> Now was the time to find the treasure. We headed for Taipei.</div>
		<div> We got there and saw it. The treasure was right in the open sitting on the sidewalk in front of a business building.</div>
		<div> I opwened it and it was full to the brim with rare coins and little gems and jewels carved into cute little kittens.</div>
		<div> But we did it. We found the treasure. All the blood, sweat, and tears had paid off. That was the happiest day of my life, right after the day I dunked on Lebron</div>
		<div> At this point my life was complete. I decided to retire.</div>
		</p>

		<div> Now I spend my days sitting on the porch sipping on mint juleps and golfing. But mainly I hit up the clubs and end up in the news for scandals and whatnot.</div>
		<div> Life is good.</div>
